### What is a Genetic Algorithm?

A genetic algorithm is an optimization algorithm inspired by biological evolution. Individuals within a population are selected based on their fitness, creating new generations. Diversity is maintained through crossover and mutation operators, and the best individuals are selected to solve an optimization problem.

### Code Contents:

1. **Solution Class (`Solution.java`):**
   - This class represents a solution for the genetic algorithm.
   - A solution is represented by an array of bits (0 or 1).
   - Solutions can be generated randomly or with a specific bit string.
   - New solutions can be produced through crossover operation.
   - Fitness value can be calculated.

2. **Test Class (`Test.java`):**
   - This class is used to test the genetic algorithm.
   - A set of random solutions is generated, and the fitness value of each is calculated.
   - Then, crossover is performed between pairs of solutions, and the fitness values of the offspring are displayed.

### Algorithm Description:

- Initially, a population is created with random solutions.
- The fitness value of each solution is calculated.
- Crossover and mutation operations are performed for the next generation.
- A new generation is created, and fitness values are calculated.
- This process continues until a certain criterion is met (e.g., reaching a specific fitness value or a certain number of iterations).
- The best solution is reported as the final result.

This way, genetic algorithms provide an approach to solving problems, where individuals within the population evolve towards the most suitable solution.
